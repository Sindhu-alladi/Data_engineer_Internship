## Internship Work Summary – ETL, SQL & Data Engineering

### Overview

This repository documents the work, learning outcomes, and hands-on implementations.I completed during my internship.

### The primary focus areas were:

ETL & Data Engineering fundamentals

SQL & Database Management

Workflow orchestration and automation

The internship emphasized practical implementation, not just theory, with real datasets, transformations, validations, and database integrations.

## Technologies & Tools Covered

ETL Concepts – ETL vs ELT

Pentaho Data Integration (PDI)

Apache Airflow (Basics)

Dagster (Basics)

MySQL

## ETL & Data Engineering

### 1. Understanding ETL vs ELT

Learned the difference between ETL (Extract → Transform → Load) and ELT (Extract → Load → Transform).

Understood real-world use cases and performance considerations.

Identified when to use ETL vs ELT based on data volume and system architecture.

### 2. Exploring ETL Tools

Studied different ETL tools and their use cases.

Practiced hands-on implementations using:

Pentaho Data Integration

Prefect (pipeline concepts basics)

## Pentaho – ETL Implementation

### Data Sources

Kaggle datasets
Custom-generated CSV files

### File Formats Used

CSV

TXT

JSON

XML

## Pentaho Tasks Performed

### Task 1: CSV File Generation

Generated CSV datasets for:

Employee

Healthcare

Finance

[View Task 1](https://github.com/Sindhu-alladi/Data_engineer_Internship/tree/main/ETL_process/task-1)

### Task 2: Single Transformation – Multiple Outputs

Converted CSV files into TXT, JSON, and XML formats.

Implemented transformations in a single Pentaho transformation.

Understood and documented each transformation step.

### Task 3: Multiple Transformations + Job Creation

Created separate transformations for:

CSV → TXT

CSV → JSON

CSV → XML

Built a Pentaho Job to orchestrate all transformations.

Implemented error handling:

If transformation fails → error message stored in an error folder

Successful transformations routed correctly

### Task 4: File to Database Table

Loaded:

TXT → MySQL table

JSON → MySQL table

XML → MySQL table

[View Task 4](https://github.com/Sindhu-alladi/Data_engineer_Internship/tree/main/ETL_process/task-4)

### Task 5: End-to-End ETL with Notification

Employee → TXT

Finance → JSON

Healthcare → XML

Loaded transformed data into MySQL tables

Configured success email notification for successful job execution

[View Task 5](https://github.com/Sindhu-alladi/Data_engineer_Internship/tree/main/ETL_process/task-5)

### Task 6: Table Mapping

Mapped Employee table → Patient table

Implemented transformations using Pentaho mapping steps

[View Task 6](https://github.com/Sindhu-alladi/Data_engineer_Internship/tree/main/ETL_process/task-6)

### Task 7: Pentaho Parameters & Scheduling

Implemented Pentaho parameters

Learned job scheduling concepts

## MySQL & SQL Practice

### 1. SQL Fundamentals

Practiced:

DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)

DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

DCL (GRANT, REVOKE)

TCL (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)

Worked with database constraints

### 2. Sakila Database

Explored Sakila sample database

Demonstrated DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL commands using real tables

### 3. EER Modeling – Healthcare Database

Designed an Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) diagram for:

```
Patients ──< Appointments >── Doctors ──< Departments
│ │
│ ├── Diagnoses
│ ├── Prescriptions ── Medications
│ ├── Lab Tests
│ └── Billing
│
└── Insurance
```

### 4. Data Ingestion

Ingested data from Employee table into Patient table

### 5. Advanced SQL Topics

Views

Stored Procedures

Data Normalization Functions

Raw → Cleaned Data Transformation

CTEs

Ordinal Positions

Information Schema

### 6. Query Optimization & Analysis

EXISTS, NOT EXISTS, IN, NOT IN

Window Functions

Indexing

Joins:

Inner Join

Left Join

Right Join

Full Join

Cross Join

Self Join

Subqueries vs Joins

## Conclusion

This internship provided a solid foundation in data engineering, covering:

ETL concepts and tools

End-to-end data transformations

Database design and SQL optimization
